# WebParser
This is a program I wrote to parse all the tags out of web page. It has functions for sorting the tags by tag name, class, and ID, as well as search functions for each category. I use it as a basis for my web parsing apps (as it can pull all the tags and search through the whole document, getting exactly what I need). There are three views in the program: a tree for all the tags, a space for general information of the tag (top right), and the bottom which holds all the html in the tag.

To use it, go to File > Enter url.
For sorting/searching, go to View > Sort By or View > Search By.
